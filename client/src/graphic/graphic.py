'''
src/graphic should contain functions and classes that handle rendering, visual effects, and graphical assets for the game.

functions included in the file should be implemented, whether in this file
or called from other modules.

in src/graphic, following functions should be implemented:
- initializing game window
- loading graphical assets (images, sprites, textures)
- rendering game UI elements and card objects on the screen
- updating the screen based on game state changes

This file should work as a module roadmap for implementing graphic functionalities in the game,
with most of the actual code being implemented in other files/modules as needed.
